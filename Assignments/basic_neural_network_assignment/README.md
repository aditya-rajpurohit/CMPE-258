# Neural Network using Numpy, Keras, Pytorch and Jax 


This repository contains a multi-framework, multi-style implementation of a **3-layer deep neural network** for solving a **nonlinear regression** problem using synthetic data generated from a 3-variable equation.

This covers implementations using **NumPy**, **PyTorch** (manual, class, Lightning), and **TensorFlow** (low-level with `einsum`, functional API, and high-level API). Includes 4D visualization and follows SOLID principles.
