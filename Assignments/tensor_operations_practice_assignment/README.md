# Tensor Operations Exploration: TensorFlow 2.0 & PyTorch

This repository contains comprehensive notebooks exploring basic and advanced tensor operations using **TensorFlow 2.0** and **PyTorch**. Understanding and mastering tensor operations is fundamental to success in deep learning and modern machine learning workflows.

---

**TensorFlow 2.0 Notebook Highlights**

- Tensor creation, reshaping, indexing, and slicing
- Mathematical operations and broadcasting
- `tf.einsum` with practical examples
- Advanced functions: `tf.tile`, `tf.roll`, `tf.gather`, `tf.scatter_nd`
- Shape manipulation using `tf.transpose`, `tf.expand_dims`, `tf.squeeze`

---

**PyTorch Notebook Highlights**

- Tensor initialization with various methods
- Indexing, slicing, and shape transformations
- Matrix multiplication using `@`, `.matmul()`, `.einsum()`
- Usage of `einops` for expressive and readable tensor manipulations
- In-place operations, broadcasting, and less-used ops like `torch.roll`, `torch.unbind`
