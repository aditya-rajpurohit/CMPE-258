# A New Era in Computational Pathology: A Survey on Foundation and Vision-Language Models

## Abstract
This paper explores how foundation models (FMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) are transforming computational pathology. By learning from large collections of histopathology images and clinical texts, these models can perform tasks like cancer detection, grading, and even report generation with minimal supervision. The authors present a comprehensive survey of the latest datasets, architectures, and training strategies powering this shift. They also highlight key challenges—like data bias and interpretability—and outline future directions for integrating these models into real-world diagnostics.
