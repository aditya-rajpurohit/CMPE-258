# Kers Hub & Teachable Machine Assignment

This repository contains examples and implementations for an assignment involving **Google's Teachable Machine** and **Keras Hub models**. The project is divided into two main parts:

---

## Part A: Keras Hub (Image & Text)

This section includes four progressively challenging Colab notebooks for **Image** and **Text** domains using `tensorflow-hub`.

### Text Projects

| Level       | Description                                           | 
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Easy        | Text classification using `nnlm-en-dim50`            |
| Intermediate| Sentiment analysis with pre-trained `bert` encoder   |
| Advanced    | Fine-tuning BERT on custom dataset                   |
| Expert      | Build a multi-label classifier using Universal Encoder|

### Image Projects

| Level       | Description                                             | 
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Easy        | Classify images using `mobilenet_v2`                   |
| Intermediate| Transfer learning with `inception_v3` on new data     |
| Advanced    | Custom CNN + Hub module hybrid                         |
| Expert      | Few-shot learning with `efficientnet` on custom tasks |

## Part B: Teachable Machine

Google's [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) enables quick training and deployment of machine learning models using simple interfaces. This section includes three example projects using different input modalities.

**Image Classification** - Distinguish between three types of objects (e.g., Cup, Bottle, Pen).

**Video Pose Classification** - Recognize different physical poses like Standing, Sitting, or Yoga Pose.

**Audio Classification** - [Deployed Link](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/zIskkmIm4/)
