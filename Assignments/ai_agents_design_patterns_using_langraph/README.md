# AI Agents Design Patterns using Langraph 


## Overview

This repository showcases **agent workflow patterns**, using two leading agent orchestration frameworks:

- [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)
- [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/)

You will find executable **Google Colab notebooks** that implement and demonstrate agent design patterns using **LangGraph APIs and LangSmith** for observability, and **CrewAI** for declarative multi-agent workflows.

Each pattern is illustrated with a real use-case and includes **execution traces**, **debug outputs**, and a **video walkthrough** of the code and design.
