# Complete End2End Modeling with Deep Learning 

This repository contains three deep learning models implemented in Google Colab as part of a class assignment. Each model focuses on a different task:
- Classification (Tabular)
- Regression (Tabular)
- Image Classification (Vision)

All experiments are tracked using **Weights & Biases (W&B)** for metrics, visualizations, and experiment logging. Each notebook includes model summaries, visual diagrams, metric reports, and error analysis.
