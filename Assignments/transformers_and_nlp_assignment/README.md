# NLP: Transformers, Fine-Tuning, and Custom Models

This repository contains a series of Colab notebooks and walkthrough videos demonstrating practical applications of NLP using **Keras NLP** and **Hugging Face Transformers**. Each notebook includes debug traces and insights to help you understand the flow of model execution.

### 1. **Inference with a Pretrained Classifier**

- **Description:** 
  Use KerasNLP hub to load a pretrained model for text classification and perform inference on sample sentences.

---

### 2. **Fine-Tune a Pretrained Transformer on Sentiment Analysis**

- **Description:** 
  Leverage pretrained BERT or DistilBERT and fine-tune it on a custom sentiment classification dataset.

---

### 3. **Build and Train a Transformer from Scratch**

- **Description:** 
  Create a simple Transformer-based model architecture using pure Keras layers and train it from scratch on a small custom dataset.
